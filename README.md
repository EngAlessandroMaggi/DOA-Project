# SET OF SENSORS AND JOINT ANALYSIS OF THE SIGNALS ACQUIRED BY IT WITH A KNOWN SIGNAL DOA 


Some of sensors are randomly placed in a 100 x 100 metre plot, to which a sinusoidal signal is transmitted.
The signal will reach the sensors with a delay depending on their position and the direction of the incident wave.

For simplicity, we assume the presence of a single source sufficiently far from the array to make the assumptions 
of far-field and plane wave.

4 TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT: 
1) TEST VARYING THE NUMBER OF SENSORS
2) TEST VARYING THE AMPLITUDE OF THE TRANSMITTED SIGNAL
3) TEST VARYING THE SNR 
4) TEST VARYING THE FREQUENCY OF THE TRANSMITTED SIGNAL





# Signal model
To understand the model in detail:

[DoA project.pdf](https://github.com/EngAlessandroMaggi/Project/files/12111256/DoA.project.pdf)

The signal pattern received by the sensor array is derived by making some simplifying assumptions.
We assume the presence of a single source sufficiently distant from the array to make the assumptions 
of far-field and plane wave.
It is possible to detect the signal's direction of arrival (DOA), from one or more sources, concerning the receiving array.
